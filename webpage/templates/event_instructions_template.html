        <h3>Instructions for Watching Video and Entering Events</h3>
{{/modal}}

        <p>Please visit our forums and watch the instructional videos in our <a href='http://volunteer.cs.und.edu/csg/forum_thread.php?id=588'>Instructional Videos</a> thread. If you have any questions please ask them in our <a href='http://volunteer.cs.und.edu/csg/forum_thread.php?id=566'>Video Watching Guidelines &amp; FAQ</a>, so we can add them to the FAQ.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>General Guidelines</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Watch the videos and report observations using the 'Event' dropdown. Each event should have a start time and an end time.  If you click on the 'Start Time' or 'End Time' text areas, they will automatically fill themselves in with the current time of the video.</li>
            <li>There must be at least one event per video.</li>
            <li>There must be an event for all times in the video aka. no gaps in the timeline.</li>
            <li>There may be multiple events occurring at the same time.</li>
            <li>If the parent is not in the video, select "Not in video" as the event.</li>
            <li>If the parent is in the video, select any event under "Parent Behavior" that is not "Not in video."</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h4>Classifying Events</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the event under the dropdown. See the list of events, and their descriptions (Table 1). 
            <ol>
                <li>The <button class='btn btn-small btn-info'>tag</button> button will become available. Click on the button and select from the available drop down. See list of tag descriptions (Table 1).</li>
                <li><i>Note:</i> Not all events have tags; therefore the <button class='btn btn-small btn-info'>tag</button> button will not be available for all events.</li>
            </ol>
            </li>

            <li>Click on the "Start Time" box. This will automatically fill in the time where you have paused the video. 
            <ol>
                <li>This will show up as the time in the video, not the time displayed in the time stamp. </li>
                <li>If you wish to change the time:
                <ol>
                    <li>delete the time displayed,</li>
                    <li>click on a blank spot on the page ("Click for start time" will reappear in the box),</li>
                    <li>click on the "Start Time" box. </li>
                </ol>
            </ol>
            </li>

            <li>When the event is over, click on the "End Time" box. This will also automatically fill in the time where you have paused the video.
            <ol>
                <li>You can change the end time the same way as the start time.</li>
            </ol>
            </li>

            <li>If you have any other comments, write them in the comments section.</li>

            <li>If you would like to discuss the event click on the <button class='btn btn-small btn-primary'><i class='icon-comment icon-white'></i></button> button. This will post a thread onto the <a href='http://volunteer.cs.und.edu/csg/forum_forum.php?id=8'>Video Discussion</a> section of our message boards.</li>

            <li><b>You can enter multiple events at the same time.</b> To do this, simply select the <button class='btn btn-small btn-primary'>New Event</button> button, and repeat steps 2 through 7. </li>

            <li> To delete an event select the <button class='btn btn-small btn-danger'><i class='icon-remove icon-white'></i></button> button. </li>

            <li>Please let us know how difficult it was to classify the events for the video with the <button class='btn btn-small btn-success'>Difficulty</button> button. You can select easy, medium or hard.</li>

            <li>If you do not want to enter events for a particular video, you can skip it with the <button class='btn btn-small'>Skip</button> button. Any events you've entered will be saved for when you come back to it.</li>

            <li>Once you have assigned all events "Start" and "End" times, as well as tags (when applicable), select <button class='btn btn-small btn-primary'>Finished</button>  to view the next video and see how your answers compared to other users (if any have watched the video). </li>
        </ol>
        <hr>

        <h4>Example</h4>
        <p>At the beginning of the video (Video Start Time: 00:00:00) the parent is absent. Three minutes in you see her waking to the nest, which takes her two seconds. She stands over the nest for 30 seconds before she sits down to incubate for the remainder of the video (Video End Time: 45:00).</p>

        <p>The events should look like this when entered:<br>
            <img src='images/example_events.png'>
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h4>Helpful Tips</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>For beginners: Watch videos at slower speeds. Some events are easily missed because they happen very quickly.</li>
            <li>To dial in the exact "Start" and "End" times when watching videos at fast speeds:
            <ul>
                <li>Once you notice that an event has happened scroll backwards on the time line. </li>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>Note:</i> The blue "fast backward" and "fast forward" buttons allow you to speed up or slow down the video (does not allow you to rewind).</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Slow down the speed of the video to real time to determine the "Start" or "End" time. </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If video quality seems poor, try restoring down the browser. Sometimes the videos become distorted if they are too large. </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Event Guidelines</h4>

        <p>Please consult the following table for information about each event and how they should be classified:</p>

        <table class='table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed'>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Category</th>
                    <th>Event</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>

            <tbody>
                {{#event_list}}
                <tr>
                    {{#new_category}}
                    <td rowspan='{{event_count}}' style='vertical-align:middle'><b>{{category}}</b></td>
                    {{/new_category}}

                    <td>{{name}}</td>
                    <td>{{instructions}}</td>

                </tr>
                {{/event_list}}
            </tbody>
        </table>
